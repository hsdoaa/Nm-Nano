In order to generate a benchmark dataset, the user has to do the following:

1- Ensure that BED file that highlights the Nm modified locations on the whole genome is in the same path where main.py file exists:

2- Run the following python command:

python main.py -r <reference_file> -f <fastq_file>

Where 

reference_file referes to the reference Genome file in FASTA format.
fastq_file referes to the fastq reads file of a specific cell line in FASTQ format.

By runnung the command above, the main.py script will lunch several command lines for generating eventalign output. These commanad lines are included in generate_eventalign_output.txt
Meanwhile the main.py will call gen_coors_Nm.py for generating the coordinate file that will be input  together with the eventalign output to  extract_nm.py for generating the benchmark dataset

Note:

-Running gen_coors_Nm.py will prompt the user to enter the BED file name with extension

-The user should include the fast5 files folder (fast5_files) from which reads.fastq file was generated in the same path of main.py

-TO allow user practicing with generating benchmark dataset, we include the following:

1-A link in fast5_files folder  to sample fast5 files on Dropbox for the Hek293 cell line 
2-A sample of fastq files (reads.fastq) for Hek293 corresponding to the fast5 files in step1 
3-A link to  sample of reference genome (ref.fa) on Dropbox
4-A sample of bed file for Hek293 cell line (hek.bed.txt)
5-The user should download the fast5 file folder from DropBox and place it in the same path of main.py file
6-The user should download the reference genome sample file (ref.fa) from DropBox and place it in the same path of main.py file
